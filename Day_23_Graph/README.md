- BFS
- DFS
- Clone a graph (Not that easy as it looks)
- Detect A cycle in Undirected Graph using BFS
- Detect A cycle in Undirected Graph using DFS
- Topological Sort BFS
  - Topological Sorting Applied for Direct acyclic graph
  - Also called as Khans Algorithms.
- Topological Sort DFS
- Detect A cycle in a Directed Graph using DFS
- Detect A cycle in a Directed Graph using BFS
- Number of islands(Do in Grid and Graph Both)
- Bipartite Check using BFS
  - A bipartite graph is possible if the graph coloring is possible using two colors such that vertices in a set are colored with the same color. Note that it is possible to color a cycle graph with even cycle using two colors.
- Bipartite Check using DFS
