- Strongly Connected Component(using KosaRajuΓÇÖs algo)
  - Valid only for Directed Graph
  - If we revers the node of the graph then we can reach to each nodes.
- DijkstraΓÇÖs Algorithm
  - Used for finding minimum distances
  - For Undirected Graph
  - Its use heap
  - Not work incase of negative edges
- Bellman-Ford Algo
  - Used for finding min distance.
  - Used in DG also use in UDG converting it into DG
- Floyd Warshall Algorithm
- MST using Prim's Algo
- MST using KruskalΓÇÖs Algo
